          <p>I presently work for the St. Charles School District as a Reading Interventionist.
             Technology has never been a strength of mine, but I love to learn new things.
             I am a hard-worker and have decided to challenge myself to learn coding.</p>

      <h3>First Experience</h3>
       <p>
          When I was a was a teen I snagged a great job teaching gymnastics.  I discovered that I loved working
          with kids and eventually earned a teaching degree in Elementary Education.  I taught both 3rd and 5th
          Grades in the Hazelwood School District. </p>

      <h3>Second Experience</h3>
       <p>
         While working on my Masters in Education at Webster, I made the decision to continue on with my education
         to gain a certificate to teach art. I already had some art classes under my belt from the Community College
         from previous years and always had a passion for the subject. After earning my art certificate
         I subsequently taught art for twenty years.</p>

      <h3>Third Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I am thankful to have a wonderful part-time job that enables me to take classes at Launchcode
          to learn about Web Development.</p>
